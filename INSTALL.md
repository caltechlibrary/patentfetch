Installation for development of **PatentFetch**
===========================================

**PatentFetch** PatentFetch uses a CSV file provided by Google's Patent search download link to retrieve patent PDFs if available.

- The individual search result page's HTML is retrieved and parsed for the meta element containing the `name="citation_pdf_url"`. 
- The citation pdf url is used to then retrieve the PDF of the patent

Quick install with curl or irm
